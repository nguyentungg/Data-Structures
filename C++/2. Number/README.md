# C++ Numeric Data Types

Boolean 	          => bool \
Character 	          => char \
Integer 	          => int \
Floating point 	      => float \
Double floating point => double \
Valueless 	          => void \
Wide character 	      => wchar_t

char 	                ==> (1byte)     127 to 127 or 0 to 255 \
unsigned char           ==>	(1byte)     0 to 255 \
signed char             ==> (1byte)     127 to 127 \
int 	                ==> (4bytes) 	2147483648 to 2147483647 \
unsigned int            ==> (4bytes) 	0 to 4294967295 \
signed int 	            ==> (4bytes) 	2147483648 to 2147483647 \
short int 	            ==> (2bytes) 	32768 to 32767 \
unsigned short int 	    ==> (2bytes) 	0 to 65,535 \
signed short int 	    ==> (2bytes) 	32768 to 32767 \
long int 	            ==> (8bytes) 	9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 \
signed long int 	    ==> (8bytes) 	same as long int \
unsigned long int 	    ==> (8bytes) 	0 to 18446744073709551615 \
long long int 	        ==> (8bytes) 	(2^63) to (2^63)-1 \
unsigned long long int 	==> (8bytes) 	0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 \
float 	                ==> (4bytes) 	\
double 	                ==> (8bytes) 	\
long double 	        ==> (12bytes)   \
wchar_t 	            ==> (2 or 4 bytes) 1 wide character

### *NOTE*
``` 
float vs. double
The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.
