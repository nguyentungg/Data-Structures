# JavaScripts Data Structures
## I. Data Structures
1. String
2. Number
3. Array
4. HashTable(Objects)
5. LinkedList
6. Stacks
7. Queues
8. Trees
9. Graphs

## II. Variables:
1. Var
2. Let (ES6 (2015)).
- Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
- Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
- Variables defined with let have Block Scope.
3. Const
4. Nothing: `Undefined`, `null`. `Undefined` has a much stronger "nothing" meaning than `null` because it is the **default value** of every variable. No variable can be `null` unless it is set to `null`, but variables are `undefined` by default.
